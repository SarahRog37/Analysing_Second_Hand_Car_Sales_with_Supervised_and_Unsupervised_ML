# Analysing_Second_Hand_Car_Sales_with_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_ML
Analysis of the second-hand car market using supervised and unsupervised  learning for car price prediction and pattern identification.

Polynomial regression was superior in price prediction of single numerical features with year of manufacture accounting for most variance. Improved prediction was achieved using RF for all 
numerical features combined. Inclusion of the categorical features for RF provided the greatest prediction accuracy of all models, with ANN also performing well. Complete linkage AHC for year of manufacture 
and price produced the best clustering, showing similarity in data distribution and clustering to k-Means. Single linkage AHC clustering highlights the importance of visual inspection alongside evaluation metrics for appropriate model selection.
